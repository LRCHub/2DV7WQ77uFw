I don't know what to do
I've tried everything, I
I'm tryna be the boy,
the one that understands
The one to call your
favorite person in the end, but
I'm stuck in limbo from
a lover to a friend
Could I have some info?
Give me a window, oh
When the things gettin' real
You love me now
What I fear
Bring me in
(Bring me in)
Toss me out
(Toss me out)
Hold my tongue
(Hold my tongue)
Kiss my mouth
(Kiss my mouth)
It's unclear of what you
want from me
Your depiction of the one
you need
Might not be
(Might not be)
not be me
I'm falling with nobody to blame
Except myself, it's all the same
The state of roasting the
glass and rosy cheeks
Dumbfounded at every word
you speak, oh
Ever have I ever felt
a love like this
(Love like this)
Oh-no-no
(Oh-no-no)
Oh no fair
You bring me in
(You bring me in)
Toss me out
(Toss me out)
Hold my tongue
(Hold my tongue)
Kiss my mouth
(Kiss my mouth)
It's unclear of what you
want from me
(From me)
Your depiction of the one
you need
Might not be
(Might not be)
not be me
(Not be me)
Fuck it
I'll stay right here with you
I'll stay right here with you
I'll stay right here with you
Oh-no-no
