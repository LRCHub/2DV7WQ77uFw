No, i don't trust them, and i think that you're one of them
Yeah, god's got plenty, but he can't get enough of them
They're taking taxes in the temple of jerusalem
And charging virgins for their stables in bethlehem

I know you think you're right
But you might not be right
I know you think i'm wrong
But i might not be wrong

I shouldn't be laughing but i think it's hilarious
Somebody died but they're refusing to bury him
He took his sword and pulled a judas iscariot
And now they're waiting on some burning chariot

But you might not be right

A herd of pigs is lying dead in the water
I swear: all i wanted were the demons cast from my daughter
But now the congregation's angry at the useless slaughter
As if i should have taken her out back, like a dog, and just shot her

You might be right
But you might not be right
