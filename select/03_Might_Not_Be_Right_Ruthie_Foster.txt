Here's a little song that I wrote with the great Mr William bell
Might not be right for the world but it's alright for this girl

You know people like to talk, but they don't understand
Reasons for relationship between a woman or a man
They talk about it but they really don't know
All of the qualities that make a love grow

Oh they're green with envy, speculate and hate
Negative thoughts don't control my fate
You know it might not be right (might not be right) for the world
Oh, no (might not be right)
Oh I said it might not be right (might not be right) for the world
Yeah, oh no (might not be right)

Well you know it might not be right
But it's alright for this girl, uh
Oh I said it might not be right
But it's alright for this girl

Yeah, well you know if they could see
How you make me feel
It would leave no doubt that this love is for real
They don't understand it and they can't comprehend
People stop and gossip on the outside looking in

Oh, they're green with envy, speculate and hate
Negative thoughts don't control my fate
You know it might not be right (might not be right) for the world
Oh, no (might not be right)
Hey eh, I said it might not be right (might not be right) for the world
Hey eh, no, no, no, no, no (might not be right)

Oh, I know it might not be right
But it's alright for this girl
Hey eh, eh, it might not be right
But it's alright for this girl
Oh, yes it is, I know it is
I know it's alright hey, for this girl

Hey you know, people don't understand it no, hey
They wanna know the reasons why
They wanna know why, why, why
Said it's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright, for this girl
Hey it's alright, alright, alright
It's alright, alright, alright, for this girl

Yeah, thank you
Thank you very much
