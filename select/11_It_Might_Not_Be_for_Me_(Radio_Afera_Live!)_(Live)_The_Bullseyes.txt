I don't want things you're showing
I don't fall for anything you say
We were good friends ago when we were younger
Now what you are might not be for me

You want to be for everyone
Yeah
And I think that's the reason we can't go on
You want to be so loud anyone could hear
And I think
I just think
It might not be for me

I've been included in your audience
Like you've included everybody else
There was a time when that would've felt rewarding
But what you are now
What you now
It might not be for me

You want to be for everyone
Yeah
And I think that's the reason we can't go on
You want to be so loud anyone could hear
And I think
I just think
It might not be for me

You want to be for everyone, be for everyone
Yeah
And I think that's the reason we can't go on, we can't go on
You want to be so loud anyone could hear, anyone could hear
And I think
I just think
And I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
I think
It might not be for me
